                    I'm a software test engineer with a passion for programming, politics and history. Programming-wise, I branch out into as many technologies as I can, and I try to actively seek out topics and challenges that I am not yet familiar with. I take the same approach to topics that I read, and hope, one day, to turn any knowledge that I gain into a literary outlet in the form of essays.

                    I try to grow everyday. I seek to learn more, program more, and turn these habits into published projects.
